# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled dataset—that is, each input comes with a known correct output (label). The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict labels for new, unseen data.

🔁 Basic Concept
You have data in the form of:
Input (X)→Label (y)

You train the model using this data so it can later predict:
New X→Predicted y

🔁 Types of Supervised Learning

1. Regression: Predicts continuous values

📌 Example: Predicting temperature, price, or salary

🔧 Algorithms: LinearRegression, SVR, SGDRegressor

2. Classification: Predicts categories or labels

📌 Example: Email is spam or not

🔧 Algorithms: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SGDClassifier, SVM, KNN
